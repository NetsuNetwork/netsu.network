# Thoughts on Astro

Astro makes it very intuitive to collaborate with others who know frameworks such as Solid, Svelte, etc.


## Dislikes

The only dislike I have with Astro is the fact that with it's Tailwind integration I can't use the `@apply` keyword within SCSS / CSS classes,
if they fix this I'd 100% stick with this framework for a very long time.
